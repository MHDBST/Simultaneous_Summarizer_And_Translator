The latest scientific achievements in the treatment of tinea
Scientists seek to use stem cells in hair follicles produce Rngynhdar on bald mice are promising new treatments that can be used to treat tinea and gray hair.
The service of Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA), the University of Tokyo in one of his experiments failed to identify a way to grow their hair and Rngdanhdar it.
This was a successful experiment on mice, the researchers hope to apply this method to be tested on humans within three years of the next decade, this treatment is widely available publicly visible.
British experts praised the researchers Japanese read their work to remedy a problem that has puzzled scientists for decades consecutively.
The result of the combination of stem cells that have the ability to turn into different types of cells and follicles obtained.
Scientists use two types of skin stem cells that together contain all the instructions for a hair follicle and grow them in the laboratory and into Fvlkvlhay formed are immature.
This product has no hair on the back of the bald mice were implanted with two to three weeks of hair growth was observed. This method can also be used to raise a mustache.
The journal "Nature Communications", be mentioned that the use of human stem cells from the stigma of a bald man's hair growth was observed in these mice.
In the future, stem cells could be extracted from a sample of the man's skin and healthy hair follicles and used it for breeding.
With this approach tens of thousands of follicles cultured in vitro and then to be injected with tinea capitis.
The research team also found that by adding a specific type of stem cell in color combinations that can produce hair.
This means that users of these therapies can have the hair color of their youth.
You can also create a therapy for those whose hair is gray.
Despite the fact that this is not a low cost re rejuvenation of stem cell therapy is likely to have cost thousands of dollars.
